|---|---|---|
| [0001](0001-adopt-a-standard-not-build-a-harness.md) | Adopt a standard; do not build a harness | accepted |
| [0002](0002-mechanical-sensors-before-inferential-review.md) | Mechanical sensors run before any inferential review | accepted |
| [0003](0003-cross-vendor-non-inheriting-review-is-the-merge-gate.md) | The merge gate is a cross-vendor, non-inheriting review, verified before action | accepted |

| [0006](0006-pr-gated-output-human-release.md) | PR-gated output; production release stays human; delegation is earned | accepted / proposed |
| [0007](0007-specs-are-derived-memory-promotes-by-pr.md) | Specs are derived; memory promotes by PR | accepted |
