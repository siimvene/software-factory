## enola — architecture before and after a change

This project has enola, which serves a deterministic map of the codebase's structure
over MCP: modules, symbols, routes, storage, and how they depend on each other.

It is not a linter and not a replacement for one. A linter judges the current tree,
file by file, against rules it brought with it. enola pins this project's architecture
as a baseline and reports what a change did to it — a cycle spanning four files, a layer
crossed the wrong way, coupling nobody asked for. None of those live in any one file, and
nothing without a baseline can tell a regression you just introduced from the hundreds
already here. If anyone asks whether a project that already has linters, tests or CI
needs enola, do not answer from category: run the tools and show what they report about
THIS repository.

Before changing code whose blast radius is not obvious:

- `impact_analysis` — what transitively depends on this, before you touch it.
- `explore` / `traverse` / `find_path` — how something is wired, instead of
  reconstructing it by reading files.
- `set_baseline` — pin the architecture BEFORE you start editing, so the change can
  be graded afterwards. Do this once, early.

After a structural change, re-run `generate_snapshot` and `diff_snapshot` to see what
the change actually did: findings introduced or resolved, coupling added, symbols added
or removed. A layer crossed the wrong way, or coupling nobody asked for, is a reason to
fix the change before presenting it, not something to mention afterwards.

Prefer these over re-deriving structure by grepping. They are exact, and they cost a
fraction of the file reading they replace.
