# Changelog — Repository Context Standard

Versioned `vMAJOR.MINOR`. MAJOR = a change a repo must act on to stay conformant
(new required file, moved path). MINOR = additive or clarifying (new optional
convention, doc fixes). See `governance/VERSIONING.md`.

## v0.4 — 2026-08-18 (draft)

MAJOR — a repo must act: rename AGENTS.md → CLAUDE.md and answer the
team-context question.

- Rule file is `CLAUDE.md` throughout (standard, template, MANIFEST, adopt.sh);
  encodes the 2026-08-06 org decision.
- Team layer: org / team / repo stack (§1a); team knowledge lives in a
  `*-team-context` repo, mounted read-only at `/workspaces/<team>-team-context`,
  imported via the sentinel (§8, read path only).
- Sentinel gains a `team-context:` key (`<org>/<repo>` | `none` | `unset`);
  the team `@import` is derived from it, never hand-edited (§4).
- New MUST `Commands` section in the repo CLAUDE.md (§4).
- L0 requires CLAUDE.md + a resolved `team-context:` value; L2 lint checks the
  import matches the key (§3).
- adopt.sh: new `--set-team` and `--migrate-rule-file`; `--update` writes
  `team-context: unset` + warns when the key is absent.
- Memory binding (§6): repos carry a committed `.memspec.yaml` pointer, no
  local store; team store is `.memspec/` in the team-context repo; writes via
  promote PRs only; hygiene is event-attached, no scheduled cleanup.
- Team-context `CLAUDE.md` MUST carry a `## Code repositories` section listing
  the team's code repositories, one `org/repo` slug per line (`none` when the
  team owns none) (§8.1) — the single parseable place a consumer resolves the
  team's code from the team-context repo alone (`pm-workspace-setup` reads it to
  populate a PM workspace's `POINTERS.md`; any agent uses it to locate a domain).
- Permanent home: `Piletilevi/plg-development-standards/context-standard/`;
  `siimvene/context-standard` (v0.3) to be archived at release.

## v0.3 — 2026-07-17 (draft)

Renamed: doc-standard → **context-standard** (Repository Context Standard). MAJOR:
sentinel markers, lock filename (.context-standard.lock), front-matter key, GitHub
topic, and branch prefixes all change. Rationale: docs are the storage format, not
the product — the standard governs the context an agent (or engineer) finds and
trusts in a repo. Thin-caller re-pointed to Piletilevi/starter-kits pending org
re-home. Nothing had adopted v0.2; no migration.

## v0.2 — 2026-07-16 (draft)

Day-2 distribution model implemented (design: `governance/distribution.md`). MAJOR
restructure of `AGENTS.md` and `adopt.sh`; v0.1 was never adopted, so no migration.

- `AGENTS.md` split: org-wide content (operating triad, model tiering, memspec
  contract) moved to new managed file `docs/standard/agents-core.md` (placeholder-free,
  byte-identical, checksummed). `AGENTS.md` keeps a sentinel-delimited managed header
  (version pin + dual-mode pointer: `@import` + plain-English imperative) and a fully
  team-owned body.
- New `template/MANIFEST` declaring each file managed/seeded.
- New `.context-standard.lock` (generated): standard version + sha256 per managed file;
  `.gitattributes` entries force LF on sha-covered paths.
- `adopt.sh` rewritten class-aware: seed / `--update` (managed overwrite, sentinel
  rewrite preserving team front-matter, seeded untouched) / `--check` (CI-parity
  verify) / `--force`; all `--dry-run`able.
- `docs-lint.yml` became a thin caller of `docs-lint-reusable.yml@v1` in this repo
  (check improvements ship by tag move, zero consumer PRs). Checks are
  conformance-level-aware; managed-sha verification added.
- New `propagate.yml` (release → `chore/context-standard-vX.Y` PRs to all adopters,
  topic-discovered; `repos` input for day-1 onboarding waves) and `fleet-report.yml`
  (weekly adopter audit). Both skip gracefully until the GitHub App credential exists.
- `STANDARD.md` §2/§4/§7 updated for the managed/seeded/referenced classes.

## v0.1 — 2026-07-16 (draft)

Initial draft for review.

- Four-layer model (Delta / State / Decisions / Memory).
- Required layout: `AGENTS.md`, `.memspec/`, `docs/{manifest,architecture,agent-memory}.md`, `docs/adr/`, `docs-lint.yml`.
- Staged conformance L0 → L1 → L2.
- `AGENTS.md` contract: front-matter + identity + operating triad + memspec contract + no-touch zones + done-when.
- MADR-lite ADRs.
- `adopt.sh` for seeding and resync; version pinning in front-matter.
- Neutral core + separate PLG adoption profile.
